-Didn't set a minimum frame rate because game is very simple, not very demanding on computer
- Surfaces:
    -Display Surface(the game window. Anything displayed goes on here)
        -Must be unique, must always be visible
    -(Regular) Surface(essentially a single image)
        -Needs to be on display surface to be visible
        -Flexible amount, only displayed when connected to display surface
